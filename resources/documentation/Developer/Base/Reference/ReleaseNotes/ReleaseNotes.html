    <p>

        The release notes include descriptions of API changes, behaviour
	changes and other information that might help developers and users
	migrate to using a newer version of the library.
          </p>

	    <h2><a name="001001000000">Version 1.24.8</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The release contains a variety of bugfixes as well as some
        performance optimisations (particularly in the use of tiny string
        objects by the new objc runtime on 64bit systems).<br />
        Thread naming and logging of threads by NSLog() has been made
        consistent with the latest OSX releases, making debugging of
        multithreaded code a little easier.<br />
        Sergei Golovin has added NSURLConnection regression tests (while
        fixing a few bugs there).<br />
        As usual, this release also contains an update to include the
        most recent international timezone data.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001002000000">Version 1.24.7</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The release has various platform/portability tweaks, as
        well as a variety of bugfixes.<br />
        The default HTTPS connection configuration is modified to disable
        SSLv3.0 support (to prevent the &apos;POODLE&apos; security attack).<br />
        This release also contains an update to include the most recent
        international timezone data.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001003000000">Version 1.24.6</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        This release contains a new class (NSUUID) and several
        new methods.<br />
        The OSX version compatibility macros have been updated
        to add the latest version of OSX.<br />
        The release has various platform/portability tweaks, as
        well as a variety of bugfixes.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001004000000">Version 1.24.5</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The main reason for this version is to release a collection of minor
        bugfixes before making more extensive changes which will break ABI
        compatibility and appear in a 1.25 branch.<br />
        This release contains a new class (NSInvocationOperation) and a few
        new methods.<br />
        The OSX version compatibility macros have been updated to permit use
        of the same numeric values as on OSX.<br />
        The release has been through the clang static analyzer (with minor
        issues resolved) and has had clang&apos;s printf format checking used
        to correct issues (mostly with NSInteger/NSUInteger on 64bit systems)
        with printf formats in various debug/logging messages.<br />
        Timezone data was updated for this release.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001005000000">Version 1.24.4</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The main reason for this version is the inclusion of the latest
        available time zone data (something accidentally omitted from the
        previous release).<br />
        Most of the other changes in this version are fairly minor portability
        and bugfixes (and the addition of a number of new testcases).<br />
        API changes are limited to the addition of a few OSX-10.7 methods
        for NSCalendar and a few new NSFileManager methods for working
        with URLs.<br />
        Finally, there is experimental code to change the hashing algorithm
        used in the library ... enabling it will cause slower hash generation
        but a better distribution of hash values ... which might improve the
        performance of large collections.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001006000000">Version 1.24.3</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release.<br />
	Many changes in this version are behavior updates/improvements
	but there are also new APIs, none of which should effect binary
	compatibility with earlier 1.24.x releases.<br />
	An important change at the configure stage is that configure policy
        now requires you to explicitly disable features in order to build if
        external packages that those features depend on are missing.  This
        should ensure that builds of base contain consistent feature sets
        unless you really want to change that.
	    </p>
    <p>
The main changes are:<br />
	Implementation of the NSXML DOM classes (previously stubs).  This is
        by far the biggest chunk of new code in this release.
        The DOM support has a dependency on the libxml2 library.<br />
	Implementation of cookies in the NSURLConnection related classes.<br />
	Implementation of common HTTPS support in the NSURLConnection
        related classes and the older NSURLHandle.  The HTTPS support has
        a dependency on the gnutls library.<br />
        Implementation of new sorting code for faster sorting and to allow
        sorting algorithms to be changed.<br />
	Many changes to add support for ObjectiveC-2.0 additions.<br />
	Implementation of Encoding/Decoding of NSAffineTransform.<br />
	Many, many minor bugfixes and tweaks.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001007000000">Version 1.24.0</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release.<br />
	Most changes in this version are behavior updates/improvements
	rather than new API, but you should be aware that there is a
	binary incompatibility on 64bit systems in that the value of
	the NSNotFound constant there is now 64bits rather than 32bits.
	    </p>
    <p>
With this release the official supported compiler for GNUstep
	is gcc-4.0 and later, and the base library has been tested using
	recent gcc development snapshots.
	    </p>
    <p>
The main changes are:<br />
	Support for the GNU LANGUAGES environment variable and other locale
	improvements.<br />
	Caching of file and directory path information within bundles.<br />
	IPV6 support for NSHost and networking operations.<br />
	Support for UTF-8 string literals in source (compiler permitting).<br />
	Improved support for building standalone application bundles.<br />
	And of course, lots of bugfixes and OSX compatibility tweaks.
	    </p>
    <p>
One this that didn&apos;t make it into this release was functioning
	NSXML DOM classes.  For DOM style work you still need to use the
	GSXML classes, however there is active work on implementing NSXMLNode
	and friends as wrappers round the corresponding libxml2 classes, and
	we hope/expect these to be ready soon.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001008000000">Version 1.23.0</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release with many minor bugfixes and tweaks.<br />
	The main changes however are David Chisnall&apos;s work adding support
	of the clang compiler and Objective-C 2.0 language/runtime (the
	compiler/runtime combination now provides full support for the
	Objective-C 2.0 language).<br />
	Garbage collection using clang and libobjc2 is now available in
	addition to the existing gcc runtime garbage collection support.<br />
	Going beyond that, for people who don&apos;t like garbage collection,
	there is now support for automated reference counting, where the
	clang compiler adds reference count calls to manage object lifetimes,
	relieving the application developer from the need to manage reference
	counts.
	    </p>
    <p>
An important point to note is that this is the last release to
	support the gcc-2.9.5 compiler.  In future, while releases may work
	with older systems, the formal requirement will be a gcc-4.x series
	compiler or later and base may also depend on support for the C99
	standard being available.<br />
	This change is being made in order avoid developers needing to spend
	a great deal of time keeping code working for obsolete systems which
	are no longer used in practice.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001009000000">Version 1.22.0</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release with many updates and changes. In addition
	to many new classes and methods, there is now a regression test
	framework included in the base release.  
	    </p>
    <p>
In addition, base now
	supports and uses the Objective-C 2.0 runtime API from Apple and
	we encourage anyone programming with GNUstep to move to using this
	new runtime and the new functionality it supports. Note however, 
	there is currently no compiler/runtime combination that completely
	supports the Objective-C 2.0 specification, but we would
	recommend the following:
	    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        gcc (pre 4.6) and GNUstep libobjc is the preferred
	compiler/runtime for stability (best tested)
      </li>
      <li>
        gcc 4.6 and GNU libobjc for experimental ObjC2 with
	garbage collection but without blocks
      </li>
      <li>
        clang and GNUstep libobjc2 for experimental ObjC2 without
	garbage collection but with blocks.
      </li>
    </ul>

	    <h2><a name="001010000000">Version 1.21.1</a></h2>
    <p>
This is an unstable snapshot release but is functionally
	identical to the 1.20-1 stable bugfix release, made to ensure
	that the latest available snapshot version of the unstable
	branch is at least as up to date as the latest stable release.<br />
	The changes in this release
	are a timezone handling update to the latest zone information,
	various minor bug fixes and portability updates, some small
	cleanups and optimizations, a few tweaks to help packagers,
	and finally an alteration to the additions library on OSX to
	add a category to re-enable serialization of property lists
	in the more readable and compact OpenStep format (something the
	most recent versions of OSX lost).

	    Working implementation of checks for conformance to protocols.
	  
      </dd>
      <dt>Installation of gdomap</dt>
      <dd>
        The installation process used to install gdomap setuid to
	  root by default (for developers/hackers) and packagers were
	  supposed to change that to not be setid, and start gdomap as root
	  at system boot time. But packagers weren&apos;t doing that.
	  The installation is now changed to install non-setuid by default
	  giving packagers more of an incentive to start gdomap properly.
	  
      </dd>
      <dt>Update of fake-main mechanism</dt>
      <dd>
        The fake-main mechanism for obtaining program arguments and
	  environment requires the library to link to the gnustep_user_main
	  function in any program which uses it.  This caused problems where
	  a distribution packaging system refuses to allow unresolved link
	  symbols in a library.  The code was reworked to use a weak reference
	  to a local function, avoiding this problem.
	  
      </dd>

	    <h2><a name="001011000000">Version 1.21.0</a></h2>
    <p>
This is an unstable release synchronized with the 1.20.0
	  stable release. There have been major changes
	  and reorganizations to support, among other things, the new
	  non-fragile ABI from clang. These changes, although they
	  break binary compatibility with previous releases, should allow 
	  all future releases to maintain compatibility.

      <dd>
        
	    Add compatibility code for Objective-C 2.0 when it is not provided

      </dd>
      <dt>non-fragile ABI</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    Support added for this ABI from clang includes additions of
	    an extra ivar for future expansion and hiding of ivars in some
	    classes.
          
      </dd>
      <dt>NSOperation</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    Complete NSOperation and NSOperationQueue

      </dd>
      <dt>Fast Enumeration</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    Support was added.
          
      </dd>
      <dt>NSLock</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    Complete rewrite of NSLock so they are faster, more complete and
	    OS X-compatible. NSLock now depends on POSIX threads.
          
      </dd>
    </dl>

	    <h2><a name="001012000000">Version 1.19.3</a></h2>
    <p>
This is a new unstable snapshot release of the base library
	almost identical to 1.19.2 but containing a bugfix for the
	introduction of a change in the behavior of NSURL&apos;s -path
	method to match OSX.  We add a new -fullPath method which
	returns the actual path of the URL the way the old -path
	implementation did.  This is necessary because the OSX behavior
	is to strip any trailing &apos;/&apos; from a path so that it&apos;s no longer
	possible to reliably build a URL string from its component parts.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001013000000">Version 1.19.2</a></h2>
    <p>
This is a new unstable snapshot release of the base library.
	It may contain minor binary incompatibilities with the previous
	unstable release, but should generally work with software compiled
	for that release.
	    </p>
    <p>
This is primarily intended as a bugfix release prior to major
	rewrite of NSLock code by David Chisnall.  As such, most changes
	are bugfixes and performance tweaks.  Some of the main ones are
	listed below.

    <p>
The current emphasis of the base library is MacOS-X compatibility,
        and the headers in this release mark many non-MacOS-X methods as being
        scheduled for removal by the next unstable release (from 1.17.0).<br />
        These methods will mostly be moved to the &apos;additions&apos; library,
        (which can be built stand-alone in conjunction with the Cocoa Foundation
        framework as libgnustep-baseadd on OSX) and their declarations will
        be in the headers of that library (&lt;GNUstepBase/...&gt;) rather
        than in the <em>Foundation</em> directory.<br />
        NB. The markup in the headers and documentation should not be
        assumed to be exhaustive ...  it is planned that the next stable
        release of the base library will enforce MacOS-X compatibility
        by default, and you will have to explicitly include headers from
        &lt;GNUstepBase/...&gt; in order to use GNUstep specific
        additions.<br />
        You should track the unstable branch of the base library (subversion
        trunk) to find out what changes your software actually needs to make.
            </p>
    <p>
The TODO list for MacOS-X 10.5 compatibility follows,
        this is all stuff which would ideally be done by the next
        stable release of this library.

	    The interface version of the base library has changed in

      <dt>Window&apos;s changes</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    A lot of the behavior of path handling in the base
	    library has changed with respect to Window&apos;s machines.
	    Windows native paths are used throughout.
	    The fileSystemRepresentation methods now use utf-16
	    as the external c-string representation on windows.
	    The local to openstep and openstep to local methods
	    are now deprecated and do nothing. Other changes to
	    classes and class variables have also occurred (detailed
	    below).
	    
      </dd>
      <dt>Path/Startup configuration</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    At the startup of any application or tool, GNUstep used to
	    look at various environment variables in order to find
	    the location of various data directories and other
	    things. GNUstep still does this, but the environment
	    variables are no longer required to find these
	    files. In addition the configuration files used to
	    override certain path behavior has been changed and
	    expanded. See the base library documentation on GNUstep
	    Configuration Files for more information.
	    
      </dd>
      <dt>NSCharacterSets</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    Character sets are included in the library itself instead

      <dt>NSPathUtilities</dt>

	    Depreciated functions GSSystemRootDirectory and

      <dt>NSRunLoop</dt>

      <dt>Unichar file paths</dt>
      <dd>
        
	      Windows supports unichar file paths, but there isn&apos;t
	      really an API for handling this. GNUstep-specific
	      methods for dealing with this have been
	      added, <code>NSFileManager&apos;s
	      -localFromOpenStepPath</code> and
	      <code>openStepPathFromLocal</code> and equivalent methods for
	      <code>NSString</code>. In most cases the Base library should
	      handle this problem internally, but it&apos;s possible that there
	      are cases where the developer wants to handle the file name
	      explicitly with system-specific functions.
